```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/settings` - Get project settings
- `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/settings` - Update project settings
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/images` - Get project images
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/images/{filename}` - Serve image file

## Development

The project is now a unified SvelteKit application with built-in API routes:

- **Frontend**: Svelte components in `gallery-portfolio/src/routes/`
- **API**: SvelteKit API routes in `gallery-portfolio/src/routes/api/`
- **Hot Reloading**: Both frontend and API changes are reflected immediately
- **Single Process**: No need to manage multiple servers

To develop:
1. Run `npm run dev` in the `gallery-portfolio/` directory
2. Make changes to either frontend components or API routes
3. Changes are automatically reflected in the browser

## Contributing

1. Make sure both servers are running
2. Make changes to either the frontend (in `gallery-portfolio/`) or backend (`server.js`)
3. The frontend has hot reloading, so changes will be reflected immediately
4. For backend changes, restart the Node.js server
