```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/settings` - Get project settings
- `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/settings` - Update project settings
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/images` - Get project images
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/images/{filename}` - Serve image file

## Development

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Backend**: A Node.js server that provides the API for managing projects and images
2. **Frontend**: A SvelteKit application that provides the user interface

Both need to be running simultaneously for the full application to work.

## Contributing

1. Make sure both servers are running
2. Make changes to either the frontend (in `gallery-portfolio/`) or backend (`server.js`)
3. The frontend has hot reloading, so changes will be reflected immediately
4. For backend changes, restart the Node.js server
